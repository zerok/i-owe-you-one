# The Proverbial Beer List

Over the course of my life I've done quite a lot that would not have been
possible without the support from some people. Others simply made my life much
simpler: People who helped me out on IRC on something that would have taken me
ages to figure out, people who fixed a bug in a library that was bugging me...

With this list I try to keep track of who I owe a beer (or some other kind of
beverage in the same price region ðŸ˜‰) for their help and support esp. related to
open source/free software projects. No particular order has been applied here.

- [Jannis Leidel][]: I don't even know where to start. Describing him as Django
  and OSS hero should give you a hint ðŸ˜‰
- [David Malon][] for his [tiny fix][gocode_fix] in GoCode that gave it GB
  support. Back then I had messed around with GB itself and various wrappers to
  get GoCode working in Emacs again. Eventually I moved on to other solutions
  but back on my last day in Poznan for PolyConf this was really important to me
  ðŸ˜ƒ
- [Stefan Koopmanschap][] for his leadership in the phpBB support community back
  when I was still new to this whole tech world.
- [Eric Holscher][] for all the work he does in the technical writing community
  and creating such awesome and inclusive events like WriteTheDocs. *At least*
  one drink is in order after that evening in Prague ...
- Whoever initially introduced me to VIM and Emacs ... I will find you ðŸ˜ƒ
